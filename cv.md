## About Me
Hardworking and enthusiastic developer with high knowledge and skills in working with the front-end stack, primarily HTML & CSS/Sass, JavaScript including ES2020. I also pay a lot of attention to my soft skills. I think the ability to work in a team is no less important than Hard skills. It should be noted that I have experience in creating small websites and web projects. For fast professional growth, I try to constantly study new technologies and approaches to software development, it gives me the ability to learn quickly. My goal is to become a professional developer which creates high-quality products.
